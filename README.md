This readme is for the purpoes of stating updates. So i created the models folder and the base model folder. Inisde it you will see a main.py file that I use to runtests on the code.. Currently I've set up the Basemodel class and I'm into file storage. which is no 5 in the tasks out of 17. i'm trying to successfully serialize and deserialize the classes into json but it's proving to be more of an uphill task than I had originally imagined so I'm stuck in the save and reload part. if you come across any tips please dm me. I haven't paid much attention to documentation but i havent flouted much pycodestyle rules. Sicne I've said a lot here my commit message will be brief and meaningless
